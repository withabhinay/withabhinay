## 🥷 About Me

<table>
<tr>
<td width="60%">

🥷 I am a developer who loves anime  

🛠️ I love building stuff — from scratch. From idea to architecture to deployment.  

🔍 Reverse engineering systems, breaking them apart to understand how they work, then rebuilding them smarter.  

💾 Recently started loving how machines are learning and trying to beat us. ML feels like the next battlefield.  

🌿 Apart from that, you will find me in nature — running, walking, thinking, resetting.  

Here is my **[CV](https://withabhinay.me/resume)**

## 🤔 FAQs 🤔

### Which Code Editor do I use?
VS Code. Of course. It’s the best.

### Which OS do I use?
I use Arch btw on my desktop computer.  
While traveling, I have my Macbook in my backpack.

### Why am I so diverse?
I love working on projects that build our future. I stay on a topic that interests me for some time and go deep into it. Then I explore something new but stay connected to the previous ones. I don’t like missing out on anything.

### What more do I do outside my computer?
Running & football — call me anytime for this. I’m in.

### What do I do when I get bored?
I watch anime, YouTube, or have long discussions with my friends about tech, ideas, and random theories.
